# Page Load Time
Well, there are many ways to analyze page load time I have done that using Pingdom and Waterfall chart in the network tab.

1) Pingdom result <br/>
Load time - 1.97s, Requests = 20, Page Size = 11.6 KB, Performance grade = B82

2) Network tab Waterfall Chart <br/>
In this it took around 1.16s
